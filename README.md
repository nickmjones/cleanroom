### This is Cleanroom
A re-engineering of the Custom Ink design system for consistency, speed, and the modern web. Cleanroom is based on three basic principles:
1. A design system should be simple and (mostly) framework agnostic
2. Convention over configuration is a good thing and definite answers to common problems
3. Easy to get started with and hack on. Minimal dependencies and common development patterns.
